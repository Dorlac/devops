Routers
    Filter and forward by IP addresses
Switches
    Filter and forward by MAC addresses
    Uses ethernet information when relying on MAC addresses

Router ports have IP addresses
    Router care about where the IP packet is supposed to go
    Use a routing table to send things places

Every router has an upstream router
Default route sends IP packets to the upstream router
Routers don't change the IP address
They change the MAC address of the packet to send it on it's way

Metric indicates the priority on the routing table
Lower is better

Routers do not care about where a packet came from
They only care about where the packet is going

packet
{data}{sequencing number}{source port number}{destination port number}{source IP}{destination IP}
destination port = {0-1023}
source port = {1024-65535}

NAT
    replace {source IP address}{WAN address}

Forwarding ports
    The point is to allow unsolicited information onto our network
        (through our router)

{source IP}{router IP}{outside port} | {source IP}{router IP}{inside port}

Port Range Triggering
    {sent port} | {sent port}{related port}

DMZ (demilitarized zone)
    Very dangerous, configured on the router
