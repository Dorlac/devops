MODEL
The model is responsible for containing the domain data
The model also holds the logic for munipulating this data
The controller then can interact with the api of the model

CONTROLLER/COMPONENT
Set up the initial state of the template 
Contain the logic to present data 
Contain the logic to update the model based on user interaction

Views/Templates 
Contains markup and bare minimum logic to present data to the user

Don't try to work with other peoples shity code. Refactor it.

DESIGN PITFALLS
Logic in the wrong place
    Putting business logic in templates, rather than in components
    Putting domain logic in components, rather than in the model
    Putting data store logic in the client model when using a RESTful service
Adopting the Data Store Data Format
    The data store is responsible for modifiying the data for the model.
Not knowing what you are doing.
    Go slow and make sure to understand everything before trying to solve the problem.
